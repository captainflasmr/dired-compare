* Summary

dired-compare is designed to provide a convenient interface for comparing directories in Dired mode using multiple external and Emacs-based tools. It supports tools like Meld, ztree-diff, ediff-directories, and more.

* Directory comparsion tools supported

** emacs built-in

- ediff-directories
- dired-diff
- dired-compare-directories

** emacs packages

- ztree-diff

** linux external

- Meld
- diff
- rsync
- kompare
- fdupes

* Whats New

** v0.0.1

Initial Version

* Installation

** use-package (emacs 30+)

Put the following into your Emacs init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package dired-compare
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/dired-compare")
  :bind
  (:map dired-mode-map
          (("C-c m" . dired-compare))))
  #+end_src

** From source

Download the `.el` file and place it in your Emacs `load-path`.

Then either manually load it or add it to your configuration to be loaded at startup:

#+begin_src elisp
(when (file-exists-p "~/source/repos/dired-compare")
  (use-package dired-compare
    :load-path "~/source/repos/dired-compare"
    :bind
    (:map dired-mode-map
          (("C-c m" . dired-compare)))))
#+end_src

* Quickish Start / Usage

So how does this work?, well now I can split windows, bring up some dired buffers, mark directories to compare, and then make sure I am in the dired buffer that is to appear on the LHS of the Meld comparison before I then run the command.  The destination directory would then be defined according to =dired-dwim-target= which I have set to =t= which is the next dired visible buffer in a clockwise direction, but can be adjusted as desired.

With a little experimentation I found out that =(dired-get-marked-files)= retrieves the dired item that the cursor is over, therefore each directory doesn't necessary even need to be explicitly marked!, so you could just split with two dired buffers, leave the cursor over the destination directory, switch to the source dired buffer and leave the cursor over the source directory before running the command above.

Given the bindings set up in the /Installation/ just run =C-c m= and choose the comparison tool, which include internal emacs functions, emacs packages and external tools.

* Examples

** Example 1 - Using Meld

Mark two directories in Dired, then choose meld:

** Example 2 - ztree-diff

Make sure the emacs package ztree-diff is installed.

Mark two directories in Dired, then choose ztree-diff

* Customization

Note that the bedrock to this package is the defintion of =dired-compare-diff-tools= where it can be extensively modified through the custom interface, for example new commands can be easily added and arguments can be added and modified for any tool of your choosing.

* Design / Algorithm / Limitations

dired-compare provides a user-friendly interface for using multiple directory comparison tools within Emacs Dired mode. It allows you to extend and customize the list of available tools easily.

* Testing

See CHANGELOG.org

* Alternative dired-compare packages

There exist a few Emacs packages that perform the functionality that dired-compare does but that don't quite provide the feature set of dired-compare.
